# Digital Image Processing Tasks

## Tasks

### Task 1: Grayscale Image with Alternating Columns
Create a 400x400 grayscale image where even-numbered columns are black (pixel value = 0) and odd-numbered columns are white (pixel value = 255). This task demonstrates pixel-level manipulation.

### Task 2: Resizing the Image
Resize the image from Task 1 to 200x200 pixels and observe the results. This task explores image resizing and its visual impact.

### Task 3: Custom Resizing Algorithm
Design a custom algorithm to resize the 400x400 image from Task 1 to 200x200 pixels, preserving image details. This task focuses on algorithm design for resizing.

### Task 4: Alternating Pattern with Two Columns
Create a 400x400 grayscale image where every two columns alternate between black and white. This task explores more complex pixel arrangements.

### Task 5: Algorithm Adaptation
Test and adapt the resizing algorithm from Task 3 for the new image created in Task 4. This task investigates the flexibility of resizing algorithms.

### Task 6: Interpolation with Built-in Methods
Interpolate the image from Task 1 by factors of 2 and 3 using bilinear, quadratic, and cubic interpolation. Compare and discuss the results.

### Task 7: Manual Bilinear Interpolation
Implement a manual bilinear interpolation function to resize the image from Task 1 by factors of 2 and 3. This task emphasizes hands-on implementation of interpolation techniques.

### Task 8: Comparing Interpolation Outputs
Compare the output of your manual bilinear interpolation implementation with the built-in function. Analyze the accuracy of your implementation.
