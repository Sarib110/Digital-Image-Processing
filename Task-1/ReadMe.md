# Digital Image Processing Task-1

## Overview
This repository contains tasks from the Digital Image Processing course. Each task demonstrates a specific aspect of image processing, such as image generation, resizing, interpolation, and algorithm design.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Grayscale Image with Alternating Columns
**Question:** Create a grayscale image of resolution 400x400 pixels where all even-numbered columns are black (pixel value = 0) and all odd-numbered columns are white (pixel value = 255).  
**Description:** This task demonstrates pixel-level image manipulation using Python.

---

### Task 2: Resizing the Image
**Question:** Resize the grayscale image created in Task 1 to 200x200 pixels. Observe and comment on the output.  
**Description:** Explore image resizing and its effects on visual patterns.

---

### Task 3: Custom Resizing Algorithm
**Question:** Design your own algorithm to resize the 400x400 image to 200x200 pixels while retaining the image details.  
**Description:** Implement a custom resizing algorithm and compare its effectiveness.

---

### Task 4: Alternating Pattern with Two Columns
**Question:** Create a new 400x400 grayscale image where every two columns alternate between black and white.  
**Description:** Modify the column pattern to explore more complex pixel arrangements.

---

### Task 5: Algorithm Adaptation
**Question:** Test if the custom resizing algorithm from Task 3 works for the new image created in Task 4. If not, adapt it to work for both images.  
**Description:** Investigate the flexibility of the resizing algorithm for different patterns.

---

### Task 6: Interpolation with Built-in Methods
**Question:** Interpolate the image from Task 1 by a factor of 2 and 3 using bilinear, quadratic, and cubic interpolation. Compare and discuss the results.  
**Description:** Use built-in functions to explore interpolation techniques and their impact on image quality.

---

### Task 7: Manual Bilinear Interpolation
**Question:** Implement your own bilinear interpolation function and resize the image from Task 1 by a factor of 2 and 3.  
**Description:** Learn and implement the bilinear interpolation technique manually.

---

### Task 8: Comparing Interpolation Outputs
**Question:** Calculate the difference between your manually implemented bilinear interpolation output and the output of the built-in function. Is the difference completely zero?  
**Description:** Analyze the accuracy of manual implementation by comparing it with built-in methods.

## Observations
These tasks provide hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in digital image processing, such as image generation, resizing, interpolation, and algorithm design.
