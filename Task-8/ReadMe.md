## Tasks
### Task 1: 8-bit Image Downloading
Download ten 8-bit grayscale images of size 500x500.
### Task 2: Loseless Predictive Coding
Implement the lossless predictive coding using: 
(a) simplest predictor (fx+1 = fx) 
(b) median of 3 pixels 
(c) one other predictor of your own choice 
### Task 3: Huffman Coding
After the predictive coding, use Huffman coding for the final compressed output and calculate the compression ratio.
### Task 4: Calculation of Compression Ratio
Apply Huffman coding on the original images as well and calculate the compression ratio. 
### Task 5: Result Reporting
For all 10 images, report the results of compression with and without predictive coding.
