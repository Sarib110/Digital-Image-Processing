## Tasks
### Task 1: Literature Reading of Skeletonization and Thinning
Read the literature to find out the working of the ‘Skeletonization’ and ‘Thinning’ algorithms.  
### Task 2: Algorithm Custom Implementation
Implement the algorithms and test it on 10 different binary images.  
### Task 3: Apply Built-in Algorithm
Use the corresponding built-in functions for the same algorithm.  
### Task 4: Result Comparison
Compare the results of your implementation with the built-in function. 
### Task 5: Describe the findings
Describe your findings about the two algorithms.
