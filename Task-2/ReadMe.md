## Tasks

### Task 1: Histogram Plotting
Read the provided images, display the images, and plot the corresponding histograms as well. 
### Task 2: Negative Transformation
Apply negative transformation to each image and show the image along with the histogram.
### Task 3: Power Law Transformation
Choose 2 values of gamma less than 1, and 2 values of gamma greater than 1. Use these four values to perform power law transformation of all three images. Explain and discuss the output images.
### Task 4: Linear Contrast Stretch
Apply linear contrast stretch all three images and show the output images and their histograms.
### Task 5: Linear Contrast Stretch on small random noise
In the ‘mid’ image randomly add 10 black pixels and 10 white pixels, and then apply linear contrast stretch. Explain and discuss the output image. 
### Task 6: Compression of first and last segment of image
In the ‘mid’ image, divide the available grey levels into three equal segments. Compress the contrast of the first and third segment by 2 and assign the remaining dynamic range to segment two. Plot the transformation function and the show the output image along with its histogram.
