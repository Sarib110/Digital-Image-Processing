Tasks
Task 1: Noise Filtering
Implement noise filtering techniques on a grayscale image. The task involves reading an image, resizing it, and applying various types of noise (Salt and Pepper, Uniform, and Gaussian) to the image. The noisy images are then displayed alongside the original image for comparison.

Task 2: Uniform Filtering with Different Kernel Sizes
Apply uniform filtering to the noisy images using different kernel sizes (3x3, 7x7, and 11x11). The filtered images are displayed to observe the effect of different kernel sizes on noise reduction.

Task 3: Order Statistic Filters for Salt and Pepper Noise
Implement and apply various order statistic filters (Min, Max, Median, Midpoint, and Alpha-Trimmed) to an image corrupted with Salt and Pepper noise. The filtered images are displayed to compare the effectiveness of each filter.

Task 4: Geometric Mean Filter for Salt and Pepper Noise
Implement a geometric mean filter and apply it to an image corrupted with Salt and Pepper noise. The filtered image is displayed to observe the noise reduction effect of the geometric mean filter.
