## Tasks

### Task 1: Image Creation
Create an 11x11 image and sequentially fill pixel values from 1 to 121 (i.e. first pixel is gray value 1, second pixel is gray value 2 and so on.) 
### Task 2: Traditional Averaging
Now implement the code to perform the traditional averaging only for the center row with a 5x5 mask of 1â€™s and count the number of operations required in terms of additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions. Zero pad the image accordingly. Display the output array as well.
### Task 3: Optimized Averaging
Repeat step, but with the optimized averaging approach.
